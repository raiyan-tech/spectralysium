# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## ✅ Fixed: Build Script Issue

**Problem:** The build script had `--turbopack` flag which isn't fully supported on Vercel yet.

**Solution:** Updated `package.json` to remove `--turbopack` from the build command.

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "next build"  // ✅ Fixed (was: "next build --turbopack")
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Pushed to GitHub - Vercel should redeploy automatically.

## Common Vercel Errors & Solutions

### 1. Missing Environment Variables

**Error:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL is not defined`

**Solution:**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add the following (if you're using them):
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-site.vercel.app
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url (if using Supabase)
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE=your_key (if using Supabase)
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_key (if using Resend)
   ```
3. Note: These are optional for the base site to work!

### 2. Build Timeout

**Error:** `Command timed out after 15m`

**Solution:**
- Usually means dependencies are taking too long
- Vercel will cache them on subsequent builds
- Just redeploy - it should be faster

### 3. Module Not Found

**Error:** `Cannot find module '@/components/...'`

**Solution:**
- Check `tsconfig.json` has correct paths
- Verify all imports use `@/` prefix correctly
- Our project is already configured correctly ✅

### 4. TypeScript Errors

**Error:** Build fails with TS errors

**Solution:**
- Run locally first: `npm run build`
- Fix any TypeScript errors
- Push to GitHub
- Vercel will redeploy

### 5. CSS/Tailwind Issues

**Error:** Styles not loading

**Solution:**
- Verify `globals.css` is imported in root layout
- Check Tailwind config exists
- Our project is already configured ✅

---

## Current Build Status

### What Should Work Now:

✅ **Build script fixed** - No more turbopack issues
✅ **All dependencies installed** - package.json is correct
✅ **TypeScript configured** - Paths and types are set up
✅ **Tailwind configured** - CSS should work
✅ **All pages created** - No missing files

### If Build Still Fails:

1. **Check Vercel Logs:**
   - Go to your deployment on Vercel
   - Click on the failed deployment
   - Read the build logs carefully
   - Look for the actual error message (usually near the bottom)

2. **Common Things to Check:**
   ```bash
   # Test build locally first
   cd C:\PROJECT\SPEKTRAL\WEBSITE_SPECTRALYSIUM\spectralysium
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

3. **If local build works but Vercel fails:**
   - Clear Vercel build cache: Settings → Clear Cache
   - Redeploy

## Quick Fix Commands

If you need to make changes and redeploy:

```bash
cd C:\PROJECT\SPEKTRAL\WEBSITE_SPECTRALYSIUM\spectralysium

# Make your changes, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: description of what you fixed"
git push

# Vercel will automatically redeploy
```

---

## Testing Locally Before Deploy

Always test the production build locally:

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# If build succeeds, preview it:
npm run start

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

If local build works, Vercel build should work too!

## What Was Just Fixed

**Commit:** "Fix build script: remove --turbopack flag for Vercel compatibility"

**Changes:**
- Removed `--turbopack` from build script
- Fixed lint command to use `next lint`

**Result:**
- Build should now succeed on Vercel
- Check your Vercel dashboard - it may be deploying now!

---

## Vercel Auto-Deploy

✅ **Enabled by default!**

Every push to `main` branch triggers a new deployment automatically.

So after pushing the fix just now, Vercel should be:
1. Detecting the new commit
2. Starting a new build
3. Deploying if successful

**Check:** Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard and see if a new deployment started!

---

## If You Still See Errors

**Please share:**
1. The exact error message from Vercel logs
2. The deployment URL (from Vercel)
3. Or take a screenshot of the error

Then I can provide specific fixes!

---

## Success Indicators

You'll know deployment succeeded when you see:

✅ "Building" → "Deploying" → "Ready"
✅ Green checkmark on deployment
✅ Live preview URL works
✅ No errors in logs

---

**The build fix has been pushed to GitHub!**

Vercel should automatically detect the change and redeploy. Check your dashboard in a few minutes!
